        <p>This nav bar takes up the whole page. I like that its different and designerish. I would put less squares. </p>
       <img src= "nav2.PNG">
        <p>Typical navbar on the top right. I like the clean modern look. I wouldnt change much.</p>
       <img src= "nav3.PNG">
        <p>Logo on top, nav under. I like that the logo sticks out and the clean look. Wouldnt change much.</p>
